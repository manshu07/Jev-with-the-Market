## 1. Trade-level audit

Trades are not stored as a table in DuckDB. They were reconstructed from stored OK decisions using the frozen Phase 4 execution rules, then checked independently against raw OPENs and timing.

BUY execution price must equal `OPEN × (1 + 0.0005)`. SELL execution price must equal `OPEN × (1 − 0.0005)`. Execution date must be the next trading session after the decision date.

Stored/experiment-path portfolio value: **₹11,22,524.610143**
Absolute difference: **₹0**
Percentage difference: **0.00000000%**

## 3. Constraint audit

- PASS no short positions observed (share counts stayed positive)
- PASS SELL exits checked against full held quantity
- PASS sell-before-buy ordering checked on every execution session

## 4. Market-data audit
