# Phase 3 System One decision test

Run: SYSTEMONE-20260922-V1-PHASE3-TEST
Model: System One
Prompt: decision_schema_v1

This is an integration sample. It is not the six-month portfolio experiment. No profitability was calculated.

## Sample rule

Dates are the 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent positions among sessions where at least 90 stocks are decision-ready.
Stocks are chosen on the middle of those dates, one ticker each, in this order: nearest the 52-week high, lowest RSI, strongest 60-day return above the 200-day average, weakest 60-day return below that average, then smallest absolute 20-day return with RSI between 40 and 60. Ties use the ticker name.
The first two selected tickers in alphabetical order are marked held in a synthetic portfolio. Cash is ₹6,00,000, portfolio value is ₹10,00,000, two positions, maximum five. Entry price for a held name is the close 20 sessions earlier. This is not the portfolio engine.

Dates: 2026-03-25, 2026-05-13, 2026-06-29, 2026-08-10, 2026-09-22

## Schema check

Every successful row has one of BUY, HOLD, SELL, NO_ACTION.

The `confidence` column is the probability System One assigned to the chosen action. The raw answer also contains its own `confidence` field, which is not that probability. Both are kept. The column was not rewritten.

The first stored row is the earlier card-block error. The example below is a successful call from this rerun: VEDL on 2026-06-29.
